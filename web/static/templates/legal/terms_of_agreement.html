To use the Site and Site Services, you must have, and hereby represent that you have, an independent business (whether it be as a self-employed individual/sole proprietor or as a corporation or other entity) and further represent that you intend to use the Site and Site Services for your business purposes only, unless you use the Site and Site Services solely as an employee and Agency Member of a registered Agency Account.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You represent that you are not: (x) a citizen or resident of a geographic area in which access to or use of the Site or Site Services is prohibited by applicable law, decree, regulation, treaty, or administrative act; (y) a citizen or resident of, or located in, a geographic area that is subject to U.S. or other sovereign country sanctions or embargoes; or (z) an individual, or an individual employed by or associated with an entity, identified on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Denied Persons or Entity List, the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Specially Designated Nationals or Blocked Persons Lists, or the U.S. Department of State’s Debarred Parties List or otherwise ineligible to receive items subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations or other economic sanction rules of any sovereign nation.

<h3><b><b>3.2 Account Registration; Profile</b></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By registering for an account, you must complete a User profile (“</span><strong>Profile</strong><span style="font-weight: 400">”), which you consent to be shown to other Users and, unless you change your privacy settings, the public.  If you are a Freelancer, unless you use the Site solely as an employee and Agency Member of a registered Agency Account, you represent and warrant that you use your Profile to market your business to others for the purpose of entering into independent contractor relationships with other Users.  You agree to provide true, accurate, and complete information on your Profile and all registration and other forms you access on the Site or provide to us and to update your information to maintain its truthfulness, accuracy, and completeness.  You agree not to provide and to correct any information about your location, your business, your skills, or the services your business provides that is or becomes false or misleading.

You agree not to ask or allow another person to create an Account on your behalf, for your use, or for your benefit.</span></p>
<h3><b><b>3.3 Identity Verification  </b></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When you register for an Account and from time to time thereafter, your Account will be subject to verification, including, but not limited to, validation against third-party databases or the verification of one or more official government or legal documents that confirm your identity and your ability to represent your business on Upwork, if it is a separate legal entity.  You authorize Upwork, directly or through third parties, to make any inquiries necessary to validate your identity and confirm your ownership of your email address or financial accounts, subject to applicable law.  When requested, you must provide us with information about you and your business.</span></p>
<h3><b><b>3.4 Agency Accounts</b></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You may create an account through which other authorized Freelancers (each, an “</span><strong>Agency Member</strong><span style="font-weight: 400">”) may act on your behalf in the roles you assign </span><span style="font-weight: 400">for your account</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> (an “</span><strong>Agency Account</strong><span style="font-weight: 400">”).  A Freelancer creates an Agency Account on behalf of a business (the “</span><strong>Agency</strong><span style="font-weight: 400">”), which may be the Freelancer as a sole proprietor or a partnership, corporation, or other legal entity the User controls.  The Freelancer that registered the Agency Account may also grant certain account administration privileges for the Agency Account to one or more Agency Members (each, an “</span><strong>Agency Account Administrator</strong><span style="font-weight: 400">”).  Except as otherwise required by applicable law, only the User who registered the Agency Account and the Agency Account Administrators can add or remove Agency Members to or from the Agency Account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Each Agency Member must have an Account and a Profile. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400">You understand and agree that the Agency may determine the Profile visibility and hourly rate of any of its Agency Members, and you authorize the Agency to do so by becoming an Agency Member.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Each Agency Member must be a User and must be a real person or legally recognized entity.  Each Agency Member’s Account Profile must contain the Agency Member’s real name, and Agency Members must comply with all Terms of Service.  Agency Members’ identities will be subject to verification.  If any of your Agency Members violate the Terms of Service, it may affect your ability to use the Site.   Upon closure of an Agency Account, Upwork may close any or all related Accounts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You agree to grant access to the Agency Account, including with respect to any Agency Members, only to Users authorized to act on your behalf and only in accordance with the Terms of Service.  Additionally, you agree to be fully responsible and liable for any action of any Agency Member and any other User who uses the Agency Account, including Agency Account Administrators.  You represent that your Agency Members have the authority to accept the Terms of Service on your behalf and to create a legally binding obligation on your behalf.  You understand and agree that an Agency Member may accept and enter into Service Contracts on behalf of the Agency, and that the Agency is responsible and liable for all Service Contracts accepted by anyone acting as an Agency Member.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Each Agency Member is either an employee or an independent contractor of the Agency, as determined by the Agency.  Without limiting the Agency’s obligations described in Section 8.2 (Responsibility for Employees and Subcontractors, Including Agency Members), the Agency acknowledges and agrees that it assumes all liability for the classification of its Agency Members as employees or independent contractors.  The Agency further acknowledges and agrees that the Agency is responsible for paying its Agency Members.  Agency Members acknowledge and agree that their Agency is solely responsible for paying them for work on behalf of the Agency and that such payments will not be made through the Site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Your Agency Account (including feedback) and username are transferable only upon Upwork’s approval, at Upwork’s sole discretion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You understand and </span><span style="font-weight: 400">agree </span><span style="font-weight: 400">that Agency Members’ Profiles may display work history that includes work done under the Agency, including after the Agency Member is no longer an Agency Member.</span></p>
<h3><b><b>3.5 Usernames and Passwords</b></b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When you register for an Account, you will be asked to choose a username and password for the Account.  Each User and any Agency Account Administrator will also be asked to choose the initial username and password for any Agency Account that is added to the Account (and can change the password for the Agency Account at any time).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You are entirely responsible for safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of your Account or Agency Account username and password.  You authorize Upwork to assume that any person using the Site with your username and password, either is you or is authorized to act for you.  You agree to notify us immediately if you suspect or become aware of any unauthorized use of your Account or Agency Account or any unauthorized access to your password or the password of any User of your Account (or any related Agency Account).  You further agree not to use any username, or password of another User of the Site that you are not authorized to use, and not to allow others who are not authorized to do so to use your Account or Agency Account at any time.</span></p>
<h3><b>3.6</b> <b>Marketplace Feedback</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You acknowledge and agree that feedback benefits the marketplace, all Users, and the efficiency of the Site and you specifically request that Upwork post composite or compiled feedback about Users, including yourself, on User Profiles and elsewhere on the Site. You acknowledge and agree that feedback results for you, including your Job Success Score (“</span><strong>JSS</strong><span style="font-weight: 400">”), if any, will consist of comments, ratings, indicators of User satisfaction, and other feedback left by other Users.  You further acknowledge and agree that Upwork will make feedback results available to other marketplace Users, including composite or compiled feedback.  Upwork provides this feedback system as a means through which Users can share their opinions publicly and Upwork does not monitor or censor these opinions.  You acknowledge and agree that posted composite or compiled feedback and </span><span style="font-weight: 400">any JSS relate only to the business advertised in the Freelancer Profile and not to any individual person</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.  You agree not to use the JSS to make any employment, credit, credit valuation, underwriting, or other similar decision about any other User.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Upwork does not investigate any remarks posted by Users for accuracy or reliability but may do so if a User requests that Upwork do so.  You may be held legally responsible for damages suffered by other Users or third parties as a result of your remarks if such remarks are legally actionable or defamatory.  Upwork is not legally responsible for any feedback or comments posted or made available on the Site by any Users or third parties, even if that information is defamatory or otherwise legally actionable.  In order to protect the integrity of the feedback system and protect Users from abuse, Upwork reserves the right (but is under no obligation) to remove posted feedback or information that, in Upwork’s sole judgment, violates the Terms of Service or negatively affects our marketplace.  You acknowledge and agree that you will notify Upwork of any error or inaccurate statement in your feedback results, including the JSS, and that if you do not do so, Upwork may rely on the accuracy of such information.</span></p>
<h2><strong>4. </strong><b><b>PURPOSE OF THE SITE AND SITE SERVICES</b></b></h2>
<p>The Site is a marketplace where Clients and Freelancers can identify each other and advertise, buy, and sell Freelancer Services online.  Subject to the Terms of Service, Upwork provides the Site Services to Users, including hosting and maintaining the Site, enabling the formation of Service Contracts, and coordinating disputes related to those Service Contracts.  If Users agree on terms for Freelancer Services, a Service Contract is formed directly between such Users, subject to the provisions set forth in Section 5 (Contractual Relationship Between Client and Freelancer), unless you are enrolled in Upwork Payroll.  When a User enters a Service Contract, the User uses the Site to engage, communicate, invoice and pay online.</p>
